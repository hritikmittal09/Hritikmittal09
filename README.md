About Me
Hello there! I'm Hritik, a passionate programmer with experience in Python and C. I have been working on various projects over the past four years, focusing on object detection, schedule management, and data collection. I am particularly interested in exploring the applications of computer vision and image manipulation using OpenCV.

During my journey as a developer, I have completed two internships in web development, where I gained hands-on experience with Flask, Django, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. These experiences have allowed me to develop robust web applications and enhance my skills in both frontend and backend development.

## Projects
Here are some of the noteworthy projects I've worked on:

# Object Detection System - 
Developed an object detection system using Python and OpenCV. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and classify objects in images and videos.

# Schedule Manager -
Built a schedule management application that helps users organize their daily tasks and appointments. The application provides a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and prioritizing tasks.

# Height Collector - 
Designed a data collection tool that collects and analyzes height data from various sources. This project involved data scraping, cleaning, and visualization using Python.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to find more exciting projects and code samples.
